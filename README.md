# Fully Home Automation System Using Deep Learning Techniques

This project utilizes deep learning techniques for personalized authentication and home automation. The system employs face recognition and voice functionality to analyze the user's behavior and generate a personalized profile. The automation of home functions is then based on the user's preferences.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to clone the repository to your local machine. Once you have cloned the repository, you can run the `chat.py` file to start the system.

### Prerequisites

The libraries are located in requirement.txt

### Installing

To install the required libraries, you can use the following command:

```
pip install requirement.txt
pip install torch
```

## Usage

To use this system, you will need to run the `chat.py` file. The system will then prompt you to enroll your face and voice. Once your face and voice have been enrolled, the system will generate a personalized profile and begin automating home functions based on your preferences.

If your system is not performing well train the model by running the `train.py`, To achieve best outcomes
